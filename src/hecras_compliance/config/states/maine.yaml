# =============================================================================
# Maine State Compliance Rules for HEC-RAS Models
# =============================================================================
#
# These rules supplement the federal FEMA rules with Maine-specific
# requirements from Maine Title 38 (Waters and Navigation), the Maine
# Floodplain Management Program (DACF), and Maine's model floodplain
# management ordinance.
#
# Key differences from the federal baseline:
#   - Maine follows the federal 1.0-foot floodway surcharge for mapped
#     floodways (no zero-rise override), so FEMA-FW-001 is NOT superseded
#   - Maine's model ordinance requires 1 foot of freeboard above BFE for
#     the lowest floor of new residential construction
#   - Maine recommends modeling the 0.2% annual chance (500-year) flood
#     for Flood Insurance Rate Map delineation of shaded Zone X
#   - Coastal V-zone requirements exist but do not apply to riverine
#     HEC-RAS modeling
#
# Jurisdiction note: Individual Maine communities may adopt standards
# that are MORE restrictive than these state-level rules.  Many
# Community Rating System (CRS) communities require additional freeboard
# or modeling of multiple flood frequencies.  Always verify local
# ordinances.

    name: 1-percent annual chance flood required
    description: >
      Maine requires analysis of the 1-percent-annual-chance (100-year)
      flood event for base flood elevation (BFE) determination on all
      FEMA flood studies.  This is consistent with the federal requirement
      but is explicitly mandated by Maine's model floodplain ordinance
      for all participating NFIP communities.

    name: Freeboard requirement (manual review)
    description: >
      Maine's model floodplain management ordinance requires the lowest
      floor (including basement) of new residential construction to be
      elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation (BFE).
      Non-residential structures must be floodproofed to at least one
      foot above BFE.  Many Maine communities participating in the
      Community Rating System (CRS) adopt higher freeboard standards
      (2-3 feet).  Because the exact requirement varies by community
      ordinance, this rule flags the model for manual review.

        Verify the applicable local freeboard ordinance.  Maine's minimum
        state standard is 1 foot above BFE for residential and non-
        residential structures.  CRS communities may require 2-3 feet.
        Check the community's adopted floodplain management ordinance
        for the exact freeboard requirement.
